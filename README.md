# FactorGraph

This python tool allows you to enter in any n, and it will first analyze how many factors that number has, and then it will make a distribution of the number of n's with a given number of factors.

Something interesting is that there is a very obvious peak in the distribution graph at 3, 7, and 11. If anyone reading this has an explanation, I would love to hear it. (also interesting that the 3 major peaks are prime).
